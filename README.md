# Connect Four AI - Implementing Minimax Algorithm

This is a simple implementation of the classic Connect Four game written in Typescript. The game is played on a 6x7 grid where players take turns dropping their pieces (either red or yellow) into one of the seven columns. The first player to connect four pieces vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.

The game includes an AI player that uses the Minimax algorithm to make its moves. The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm that is commonly used in two-player turn-based games like Connect Four.
